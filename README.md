There's nothing more chileand than a Completo. Completo is a king of hot-dog but made with more ingredients and love. It's for lunch, breakfast, dinner. You can eat a Completo in everytime, eveywhere, when you sad or happy. A completo is part of the life of any chileand in Chile or overseas, that's is why I put "completo dx" as name of this software.
